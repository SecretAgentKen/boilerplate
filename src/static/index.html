	This is the only raw HTML file we need. Above we set the viewport meta tag as Bootstrap is responsive. 
	This allows the page to work on mobile and a range of desktop sizes.
	Below we have our body with a single div with an id of "app". This is what App.vue gets bound to in ui.js.
	Finally we include "main.js" which is the generated JS file from webpack specified as the output filename.
-->

<body>
	<div id="app">
	</div>
	<script src="main.js"></script>
</body>
